# WurstMinus-Two-PluginBase
Wurst- 2 PluginBase

This is a template project that can be used to create new Wurst- 2 plugins.

# TODO:
* Go through Gradle build settings and remove uneeded stuff.
* Do more bug testing and fixing.
* Add away to scan / check over the plugin for certain calls that could be dangerous. (Pause the program and prompt the user on which plugin and what the plugin is trying todo.)
